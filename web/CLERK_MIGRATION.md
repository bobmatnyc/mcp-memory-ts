# Clerk Authentication Migration - Complete

This document summarizes the migration from NextAuth.js to Clerk authentication in the MCP Memory web interface.

## Migration Summary

Successfully replaced NextAuth.js with Clerk authentication v5.7.5. All authentication flows now use Clerk's managed authentication system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Updated

**File: `web/package.json`**
- ❌ Removed: `next-auth@^4.24.0`
- ✅ Added: `@clerk/nextjs@^5.7.5`

### 2. Root Layout Updated

**File: `web/app/layout.tsx`**
- Replaced `<AuthProvider>` (NextAuth SessionProvider) with `<ClerkProvider>`
- Clerk provider now wraps the entire application

### 3. Middleware Updated

**File: `web/middleware.ts`**
- Replaced NextAuth middleware with Clerk's `clerkMiddleware`
- Updated to use Clerk v5 API with `createRouteMatcher`
- Public route: `/` (landing page)
- All other routes protected by Clerk authentication

### 4. Authentication Helper Updated

**File: `web/lib/auth.ts`**
- Replaced `getServerSession` and `authOptions` with Clerk's `auth()` and `currentUser()`
- Updated to use `@clerk/nextjs/server` imports (v5 API)
- Removed `requireAuth()` function (no longer needed)
- `getUserEmail()` now:
  1. Gets userId from Clerk's `auth()`
  2. Fetches user details with `currentUser()`
  3. Extracts email from Clerk's user object
  4. Ensures user exists in MCP Memory database

### 5. API Routes Updated

**Files: All API routes in `web/app/api/`**
- No direct changes needed
- All routes use `getUserEmail()` from `lib/auth.ts`
- Authentication automatically handled by updated `getUserEmail()` function

### 6. Navbar Component Updated

**File: `web/components/layout/navbar.tsx`**
- Replaced `useSession()` and `signOut()` with Clerk's `useUser()` and `<UserButton>`
- Removed custom sign out button
- Clerk's `<UserButton>` provides built-in profile/sign out UI

### 7. Landing Page Updated

**File: `web/app/page.tsx`**
- Replaced NextAuth redirect logic with Clerk's `auth()` check
- Added Clerk's `<SignInButton>` component for authentication
- Modal sign-in experience (no redirect to separate page)

### 8. Dashboard Page Updated

**File: `web/app/dashboard/page.tsx`**
- Replaced `requireAuth()` with direct `auth()` check
- Updated environment variable from `NEXTAUTH_URL` to `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`

### 9. Removed Files

**Deleted:**
- `web/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` (NextAuth API route)
- `web/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` (Custom sign-in page)
- `web/app/auth/error/page.tsx` (Custom error page)

### 10. Auth Provider Simplified

**File: `web/components/providers/auth-provider.tsx`**
- Removed NextAuth's `SessionProvider`
- Now a simple pass-through component (kept for backwards compatibility)
- ClerkProvider is used directly in root layout instead

### 11. Environment Configuration

**Created Files:**
- `web/.env.local` - Test environment with Clerk test keys
- `web/.env.production` - Production environment with Clerk live keys
- `web/.env.local.example` - Example configuration file

**Updated Files:**
- `web/.gitignore` - Added `.env.production` to ignore list

## Environment Variables

### Test Environment (.env.local)
```env
# Database
TURSO_URL=libsql://your-database.turso.io
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Clerk Test
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_<your_publishable_key>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_<your_secret_key>
```

### Production Environment (.env.production)
```env
# Database
TURSO_URL=libsql://your-database.turso.io
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Clerk Production
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_<your_publishable_key>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_<your_secret_key>
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Simpler Authentication Flow
- No need to configure OAuth providers manually
- Clerk handles all authentication UI and flows
- Built-in user management dashboard

### 2. Better User Experience
- Modal sign-in (no page redirects)
- Professional user profile UI with `<UserButton>`
- Automatic session management

### 3. Enhanced Security
- Clerk manages session tokens and security
- Built-in protection against common attacks
- Regular security updates from Clerk

### 4. User Isolation
- Still maintains MCP Memory's user isolation by email
- `getUserEmail()` ensures user exists in database
- All API routes properly isolated per user

## Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Sign in with Clerk works (modal appears)
- [ ] User is redirected to dashboard after sign in
- [ ] Navbar shows user email and profile button
- [ ] API routes return data for authenticated user only
- [ ] Sign out works and redirects to landing page
- [ ] Different users see different memories (user isolation)
- [ ] Stats dashboard loads correctly
- [ ] Memory creation/search works
- [ ] Entity management works

## Known Issues

### Build Warnings (Pre-existing, not Clerk-related)
The following TypeScript errors exist in the parent project and are unrelated to the Clerk migration:
- Type errors in `src/core/memory-core.ts` (implicit any types)
- Type errors in `src/database/operations.ts` (implicit any types)
- Module resolution issues with `.js` extensions in imports

These should be fixed in the parent project's TypeScript configuration.

## Migration Commands

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
cd web && npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your credentials

# 3. Run development server
npm run dev

# 4. Test authentication
# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Click "Sign In" and test Clerk authentication
```

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback to NextAuth:

1. Restore `package.json` with `next-auth@^4.24.0`
2. Restore previous versions of files from git
3. Restore deleted auth pages and API route
4. Run `npm install`
5. Update `.env.local` with NextAuth variables
