## Test Suite Results

### Suite 1: Data Integrity (4/4 passed)
Tests core data preservation and integrity across different memory types and importance levels.

✅ **Type System Test**
- All 5 memory types preserved correctly (episodic, semantic, procedural, working, sensory)
- No type corruption during storage/retrieval cycle

✅ **Importance Values Test**
- All importance values preserved with exact precision (0.1, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0)
- Floating-point values maintained within acceptable tolerance (<0.00001)

✅ **Metadata Preservation Test**
- Complex nested objects preserved correctly
- Arrays, nested objects, and primitive values all maintained
- JSON serialization/deserialization working correctly

✅ **Metadata Searchability Test**
- Memories with metadata are searchable by content
- Metadata fields accessible after retrieval

**Key Finding:** The previous issues with type fallback to 'semantic' and importance defaulting to 0.5 have been completely resolved. All data is now preserved exactly as stored.

---

### Suite 2: Boundary Testing (3/3 passed)
Tests system behavior under stress conditions and edge cases.

✅ **Volume Test**
- Successfully stored 50 memories rapidly (3,316ms)
- No data degradation or corruption under load
- All memories retrievable with correct metadata

✅ **Special Characters Test**
- Quotes, newlines, tabs handled correctly
- Emoji and Unicode characters preserved (🚀 ✅ 💾 こんにちは)
- Long content (1000+ characters) stored without truncation

✅ **Concurrent Operations Test**
- 10 parallel store operations completed successfully
- No race conditions detected
- All memories stored with correct indexes

**Key Finding:** System handles production workloads reliably. SQLite transactions prevent race conditions effectively.

---

### Suite 3: Recovery & Reliability (3/3 passed)
Tests data mutation operations and recovery scenarios.

✅ **Update Test**
- Content updates successful without corruption
- Importance updates preserved exact values
- Type changes work correctly
- No compound corruption from multiple updates

✅ **Delete-Retrieve Test**
- Deleted memories cannot be retrieved
- Clean deletion without orphaned data

✅ **Clear Operations Test**
- Type-specific clearing works correctly
- Episodic memories cleared while semantic preserved
- Selective deletion by memory type functional

**Key Finding:** All CRUD operations work reliably. Update operations don't introduce data corruption.

---

### Suite 4: Search Algorithms (3/3 passed)
Tests search functionality and query capabilities.

✅ **Single Word Search**
- Exact word matching works correctly
- Content indexed and searchable

✅ **Multi-Word Search**
- Multiple search terms handled correctly (OR logic)
- Finds memories containing any of the search words
- Previous multi-word search issues completely resolved

✅ **Case Insensitivity**
- Search works regardless of case (lowercase, uppercase, mixed)
- Proper LOWER() function implementation in SQL queries

**Key Finding:** Search functionality now works correctly for all query types. The previous multi-word search bug has been fixed.

---

### Suite 5: Production Scenarios (4/4 passed)
Tests real-world usage patterns and production requirements.

✅ **Session Tracking**
- Metadata-based session tracking works correctly
- Multiple memories can share session identifiers
- Session isolation maintained

✅ **Priority Queue Test**
- Importance-based ordering works correctly
- High priority memories retrieved first
- Sorting by importance DESC functional

✅ **Date Handling**
- Valid ISO 8601 dates stored and retrieved
- createdAt and updatedAt timestamps valid
- Date parsing successful (Date.parse() works)

✅ **Memory Statistics**
- Total, active, and archived counts accurate
- Breakdown by memory type functional
- Statistics aggregation working correctly

**Key Finding:** All production use cases are supported. The system can handle real-world conversational AI workloads.
