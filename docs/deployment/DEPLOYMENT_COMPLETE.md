## How to Start Testing

### 1. Open Application
```bash
# In browser
open http://localhost:3001
```

### 2. Start Monitoring Logs
```bash
# In a terminal window
pm2 logs mcp-memory-web --lines 100
```

### 3. Perform Test Sync

**Steps**:
1. Sign in to the application
2. Go to Settings → Google Integration
3. Connect your Google account (if not connected)
4. Navigate to Sync page
5. Select "Google Contacts" tab
6. Choose sync direction (Import recommended for first test)
7. Enable "Auto-merge duplicates"
8. Click "Start Sync"

**Watch the terminal** - you'll see detailed logs!

### 4. Verify Logging

**Look for**:
- Request ID: `[req-xxxxxxxx]`
- Component prefix: `[GoogleContactsSync]`
- User authentication confirmation
- Progress updates per batch
- Completion summary
- No errors (or detailed error messages if any occur)

**Example of what you'll see**:
```
[GoogleContactsSync] [req-a7b3c9d2] Starting sync request
[GoogleContactsSync] [req-a7b3c9d2] User authenticated: your-email@example.com
[GoogleContactsSync] [req-a7b3c9d2] Sync direction: import
[GoogleContactsSync] [req-a7b3c9d2] Retrieved 150 contacts from Google
[GoogleContactsSync] [req-a7b3c9d2] Processing batch 1/3 (50 contacts)
...
[GoogleContactsSync] [req-a7b3c9d2] Sync completed in 45.2s
```

## Quick Commands

### Monitor Logs
```bash
# Real-time monitoring
pm2 logs mcp-memory-web

# Google sync only
pm2 logs mcp-memory-web | grep GoogleContactsSync

# Errors only
pm2 logs mcp-memory-web --err
```

### Check Status
```bash
# PM2 status
pm2 status mcp-memory-web

# Health check
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health | jq .

# Open app
open http://localhost:3001
```

### Restart if Needed
```bash
# Restart server
pm2 restart mcp-memory-web

# Check logs after restart
pm2 logs mcp-memory-web --lines 50
```

---

## What to Expect During Sync

### Small Sync (<50 contacts)
- **Duration**: 5-15 seconds
- **Batches**: 1
- **Logs**: ~20-30 log lines

### Medium Sync (50-200 contacts)
- **Duration**: 15-60 seconds
- **Batches**: 1-4
- **Logs**: ~50-100 log lines

### Large Sync (200+ contacts)
- **Duration**: 1-3 minutes
- **Batches**: 4+
- **Logs**: 100+ log lines

**All logs will be tagged with the same request ID** so you can trace the entire operation.

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Server Not Responding
```bash
pm2 restart mcp-memory-web
pm2 logs mcp-memory-web --err --lines 50
```

### No Logs Appearing
1. Check LOG_LEVEL is set to 'info' (default)
2. Verify sync actually started (check UI)
3. Ensure you're signed in
4. Check Google OAuth is connected

### Authentication Errors
```bash
# Check error logs
pm2 logs mcp-memory-web --err

# Common fix: Reconnect Google account
# Go to Settings → Google Integration → Disconnect → Reconnect
```

### Sync Failing
1. **Look for ERROR in logs** - shows exact problem
2. **Check request ID** - trace full operation
3. **Read suggestions** - logs include recovery steps
4. **Verify OAuth tokens** - may need to reconnect
