# Entity Database Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Project**: mcp-memory-ts
**Operation**: Entity cleanup (test data, duplicates, low-quality records)

---

## 📊 Cleanup Results

### Overall Statistics
- **Initial Count**: 3,657 entities
- **Final Count**: 2,398 entities
- **Total Deleted**: 1,281 entities (34.4% reduction)
- **Backup Created**: `entities_cleanup_backup_20251014173740`

### Breakdown by Category

| Category | Count Deleted | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Test Entities | 26 | Entities with "test" or "integration" in name, test user_ids |
| Duplicates | 148 | Same name + user_id combinations (kept oldest) |
| Low-Quality | 1,107 | Person entities with no contact info |
| **TOTAL** | **1,281** | |

---

## ✅ Verification Results

### Remaining Issues
- **Test Entities**: 10 remaining (down from 26)
  - Some may have "test" in name but are legitimate entities
  - Manual review recommended

- **Duplicate Groups**: 1 remaining (down from 141)
  - Likely edge case with unusual data
  - Manual review recommended

### Data Quality Improvement
- **Person entities with contact info**: 99.7% (up from ~70%)
- **Total entity types**:
  - Person: 2,329 (97.1%)
  - Project: 51 (2.1%)
  - Organization: 17 (0.7%)
  - Concept: 1 (0.0%)

## 🔄 Rollback Instructions

If you need to restore the original data:

```sql
-- Connect to your Turso database
DROP TABLE entities;
ALTER TABLE entities_cleanup_backup_20251014173740 RENAME TO entities;
```

**Warning**: Only use rollback if there are issues with the cleanup. The backup table will consume additional database space.

## 🧹 Cleanup Details

### 1. Test Entities Removed (26)
- Entities with "test" or "integration" in name
- Entities with test user_ids (e.g., `test-user-*`)
- System test entities from integration tests

**Sample removed**:
- Test Entity (person) - multiple instances
- Debug Entity (person)
- Integration Test Entity (other)
- Test CLI Entity (other)

### 2. Duplicate Entities Removed (148)
- 141 duplicate groups identified
- Kept oldest record per group
- Deleted 148 newer duplicates

**Top duplicates removed**:
- "Jordan Morgan" (4 instances → 1)
- "Test Entity" (4 instances → 1)
- "David Goodman" (3 instances → 1)
- "Josh Knowles" (3 instances → 1)
- "Lukman Ramsey" (3 instances → 1)
- Plus 136 other duplicate groups with 2 instances each

### 3. Low-Quality Person Entities Removed (1,107)
- Person entities with NO contact information
- Empty or NULL `contact_info` field
- Likely placeholder or incomplete records

**Criteria for removal**:
- `entity_type = 'person'`
- `contact_info IS NULL OR contact_info = '{}' OR contact_info = ''`

## 🔐 Foreign Key Handling

The cleanup script properly handled all foreign key constraints:

### Tables with FK references to entities:
1. **relationships** - `from_entity_id`, `to_entity_id` (deleted)
2. **entity_embeddings** - `entity_id` (deleted)
3. **memories** - `entity_id` (set to NULL)
4. **interactions** - `entity_id` (deleted)
5. **entities** (self-reference) - `client_id` (set to NULL)

### Cleanup Order (for each category):
1. Delete relationships
2. Delete entity embeddings
3. Clear entity_id in memories
4. Delete interactions
5. Clear client_id references (both directions)
6. Delete entities

## 📈 Impact Analysis

### Database Size Reduction
- **Entities table**: Reduced by 34.4%
- **Related tables**: Cascade deletions in relationships, embeddings, interactions
- **Estimated space savings**: ~30-40% in entity-related tables

### Data Quality Improvement
- **Contact info coverage**: 70% → 99.7% (for person entities)
- **Duplicate elimination**: 141 groups → 1 group
- **Test data removal**: 26 test entities removed

### Performance Improvements
- Faster entity queries (34% fewer records)
- Reduced storage and backup size
- Cleaner data for vector search operations

## 🛠️ Scripts Used

### Cleanup Execution
```bash
npm run cleanup:entity
# or for dry-run preview:
npm run cleanup:entity:dry-run
```

### Script Location
- **Main script**: `/scripts/execute-entity-cleanup.ts`
- **Package.json commands**: Lines 64-65

## 📝 Recommendations

### Remaining Issues
1. **Review 10 remaining test entities**
   - May be legitimate entities with "test" in name
   - Consider manual review or more refined cleanup criteria

2. **Investigate 1 remaining duplicate**
   - Check for edge cases in duplicate detection logic
   - May have subtle differences (case, whitespace, etc.)

3. **Review entities with no description/metadata**
   - Only 0.5% of person entities have descriptions
   - Only 0.0% have metadata
   - Consider enrichment or data collection improvements

### Future Cleanup Cycles
- **Schedule**: Consider quarterly cleanup of low-quality entities
- **Criteria**: Monitor entities without contact info
- **Automation**: Add pre-commit hooks to prevent test entity creation
