# Gmail Extraction Retry - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Objective

Fix UNIQUE constraint errors when retrying failed Gmail extractions by implementing automatic cleanup of stale extraction logs.

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Changes Made

#### 1. Database Operations Enhancement
**File**: `/Users/masa/Projects/mcp-memory-ts/src/database/operations.ts`

Added new method `deleteStaleExtractionLogs()`:
- Deletes non-completed (`failed`, `processing`) extraction logs
- Returns count of deleted records
- Protects completed extractions from deletion

```typescript
async deleteStaleExtractionLogs(userId: string, weekIdentifier: string): Promise<number> {
  const result = await this.db.execute(
    `DELETE FROM gmail_extraction_log
     WHERE user_id = ?
     AND week_identifier = ?
     AND status != 'completed'`,
    [userId, weekIdentifier]
  );
  return (result as any).changes || 0;
}
```

#### 2. Gmail Extraction Service Update
**File**: `/Users/masa/Projects/mcp-memory-ts/src/services/gmail-extraction-service.ts`

Enhanced `extractWeek()` method with cleanup logic:
- Step 1: Check if week already completed (skip if true)
- **Step 2: Clean up stale records** (NEW)
- Step 3: Create new extraction log (now safe from UNIQUE constraint)

```typescript
// 2. Clean up any stale non-completed records to allow retries
const deleteResult = await this.db.execute(
  `DELETE FROM gmail_extraction_log
   WHERE user_id = ?
   AND week_identifier = ?
   AND status != 'completed'`,
  [userId, weekIdentifier]
);
const deletedCount = (deleteResult as any).changes || 0;
if (deletedCount > 0) {
  console.log(
    `[GmailExtractionService] Cleaned up ${deletedCount} stale extraction log(s) for retry (user: ${userId}, week: ${weekIdentifier})`
  );
}
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Problem Analysis
- **UNIQUE constraint**: `gmail_extraction_log(user_id, week_identifier)`
- **Original behavior**: `checkExtractionLog()` only prevented re-extraction of completed weeks
- **Issue**: Failed/processing records blocked retry attempts with UNIQUE constraint errors

### Solution Approach
- **Pattern**: "Check and Delete" before INSERT
- **Safety**: Only deletes non-completed records (failed/processing)
- **Transparency**: Logs cleanup actions for visibility
- **Atomicity**: DELETE + INSERT sequence is safe for typical use

### Behavior Matrix

| Previous Status | Cleanup Action | New Extraction |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| `completed` | ❌ Not deleted | ❌ Skipped (already extracted) |
| `failed` | ✅ Deleted | ✅ Proceeds normally |
| `processing` | ✅ Deleted | ✅ Proceeds normally |
| None | ➖ Nothing to delete | ✅ Proceeds normally |

## ✅ Verification Results

### TypeScript Compilation
```bash
✅ npm run type-check - PASSED
✅ npm run build - PASSED
```

### Code Quality
```bash
✅ Linting - PASSED (warnings only, no errors)
✅ Type safety - MAINTAINED
✅ Pattern consistency - FOLLOWS existing codebase patterns
```

### Test Coverage
- [x] TypeScript compilation
- [x] Build without errors
- [x] Linting passed
- [ ] Manual test (requires database setup)
- [ ] Integration test (requires full environment)

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### Performance
- **Overhead**: Minimal (single DELETE query)
- **Database load**: Negligible (0-1 records typically)
- **User experience**: Improved (no manual cleanup needed)

### Security
- ✅ User isolation maintained
- ✅ Completed extractions protected
- ✅ No data loss risk

### Maintainability
- ✅ Surgical fix (minimal changes)
- ✅ Clear logging for debugging
- ✅ Follows existing patterns
- ✅ Well-documented

## 🚀 User Experience

### Before
```
1. Attempt extraction → fails
2. Retry → UNIQUE constraint error ❌
3. Manual cleanup required
4. Retry again → success
```

### After
```
1. Attempt extraction → fails
2. Retry → auto cleanup → success ✅
```

## 📝 Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:
- `EXTRACTION_RETRY_FIX.md` - Detailed technical documentation
- `EXTRACTION_RETRY_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary
- Inline code comments explaining cleanup logic

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Database Constraints**: UNIQUE constraints require careful retry logic
2. **Cleanup Patterns**: "Check and Delete" is effective for retry scenarios
3. **Logging**: Transparent logging aids debugging and monitoring
4. **Safety First**: Protect completed operations, allow failed retries

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements (not required for current fix):
- [ ] Add metrics for cleanup frequency
- [ ] Implement automatic stale record cleanup (background job)
- [ ] Add retry count tracking
- [ ] Consider exponential backoff for retries

## ✨ Code Quality Metrics

- **Lines changed**: ~30 total
  - DatabaseOperations: +14 lines
  - GmailExtractionService: +16 lines
- **Net new lines**: +30 LOC
